            <p>Event bubbling is a term you might have come across on your JavaScript travels. It relates to the order in which event handlers are called when one element is nested inside a second element, and both elements have registered a listener for the same event (a click, for example) </p>

            <h3>4.  What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h3>
            <p>A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action. The above example is a synchronous callback, as it is executed immediately. </p>
